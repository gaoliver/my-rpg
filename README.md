# My RPG Character

This is a personal project to exercise my JavaScript skills, using React.js.

In the project, you can use de action input to do some changes, like:

- **Change properties**:
  Just type "change
  <span style="color: gold">_property_name_</span><span style="color: red">\*</span> to <span style="color: gold">_new_value_</span>", and send to see the change happen.

- **Actions**:
  You can just type an action to see it happening. For now, you can just do actions like: walk<span style="color: red">\*</span>, fight, presentation.

- **Talk**: You can make the character talk, only typing whatever you want it to say.

<br>

> walk<span style="color: red">\*</span>: You can also pass a parameter to define how is the caracter walking (fast, alone, quickly...)

> <span style="color: gold">_property_name_</span><span style="color: red">\*</span>: name, type or weapon.

## How to run the project

just clone the repo to your machine, by clicking on clone, copying the command and running it on your terminal/CMD.

Then, on terminal/CMD, run the code below:

And wait for it to start. The project will open automatically.
